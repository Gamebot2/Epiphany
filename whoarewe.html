                        <p>
                            Epiphany was created to connect residents in level of care homes with UT student volunteers though personalized art performances, improving their
                            quality of life. We want to help people in need through the new fields of musical and artistic therapy,
                            as well as provide students and other artists an avenue with which they can use their talents to 
                            better the community. We intend to make the process of communication between residents and artists much
                            more streamlined through the creation of a mobile application, while also raising awareness for 
                            the problems that memory patients face. Within a few years, we aim to foster a community of caring
                            and giving around this issue, with the intent of improving society as a whole.
